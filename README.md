# Text-Detection-Program
This is my project for Advance Robot System Class


Self-driving car or walking robot is highly developed these days. For that, real time text recognition has been a certain topic that attract many researchers. As real time recognition is needed, itâ€™s not just accuracy but also processing time becomes an issue here. Text recognition can be implemented as robot vision for guiding the direction or location. This project develops real time text recognition using mobile device.
